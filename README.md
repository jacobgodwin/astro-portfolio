# Jacob Godwin â€“ Astro Portfolio Site

Welcome to the source code for my personal developer portfolio built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). This site was primarily built as a means to update my portfolio site to something more clean and minimal while also exploring a new framework, Astro. It also used this as an opportunity to learn new skills, like integrating with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and using that as a content backend.
